## Description

SQL Zoo is one of the few resources online that actually lets you build and run queries against existing tables. Each tutorial will show you a table and then have you run queries against it to answer specific questions. Some of the queries, particularly at first, are quite simple. They definitely get more challenging towards the end and can be real head scratchers.

## My goals

It seems knowing the fundamentals of SQL is vital to writing efficient code in Rails. This is the last project before we begin the Rails course in TOP. I will take as much time as needed to learn the syntax and logic of SQL before moving on. From completing some of the other SQL assignments before this last one, I feel the syntax isn't too complicated but the actual queries can be quite tricky.
